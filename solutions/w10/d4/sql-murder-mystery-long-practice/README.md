# Long Practice: SQL Murder Mystery

In this long practice, you will be practicing your SQL queries in a game to
solve a murder mystery.

## Set up

This activity will utilize an [external resource]. 
This game has limited structure to it. There are no step-by-step prompts, rather 
you must use your SQL skills to query and filter tables to obtain relevant 
information.

## Getting started

Read through the instructions on the website. The starting information given to 
you includes the fact that there was a `murder` that occurred on `Jan. 15, 2018` 
in `SQL City`. Based on this information you should be able to work your way
around the tables with SQL queries, learning more about the events and people 
involved. You should ultimately be able to make your way to discovering who 
committed the crime.

## Tips

The Knight Lab website provides several great resources as you try to uncover 
the mysteries of this crime.

Under the `Exploring the Database Structure` heading, you can see how to 
determine the tables that are present in the database as well as their column 
structure. If you need additional help visualizing the database, there is also 
a schema diagram available under the heading `The rest is up to you!`.

The [walkthrough] provided on the Knight Lab website is also a great refresher 
on the basics of SQL and databases. If you are having trouble making headway 
into the case, the walkthrough will provide steps to take to narrow down the 
suspects and progress to your final solution. Try exploring the tables before 
heading to the walkthrough!

## Good Luck!

Use your SQL knowledge and logic to learn about the events and people involved, 
and help find justice in SQL City!
