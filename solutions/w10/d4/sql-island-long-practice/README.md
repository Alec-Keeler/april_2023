# Long Practice: SQL Island

In this long practice, you will be practicing your SQL queries in a game to
escape an island.

## Set up

This activity will utilize an [external resource]. 
This game was created by a German university. The following instructions will 
get you set up to play the game.

## Change the Language

The website defaults to German, but can be changed to play in English with a few 
quick steps.

![language-change]

1. Select the hamburger menu from the top left corner.
2. Select the third option in the menu, `'Sprache wechseln'`, or `'Change language'`
in German.
3. In the new overlay, select `'English'`.

## General Instructions

The game plays out all within the application's main page. You will be prompted
with story details and SQL queries that should be executed to progress the 
story.

> Whenever the `'Continue'` button is disabled, there is a SQL query that you 
> should run and `'Submit'` to progress the story.

## `JOIN` Statements

During the game, you will be prompted to join two tables together. The game uses
a slightly different approach than you may be used to at this point (using two 
tables in the `FROM` clause). The example that is given in the game works with 
this slightly different format, but try to utilize a `JOIN` statement instead.

## Good Luck!

Use your SQL knowledge, learn about the residents of the island, and good luck 
getting back home safely!
